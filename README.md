# OpenGL Scratchpad

A scratchpad for OpenGL based experimentation, intended for rapid iteration, integration and simplicity rather than
 optimisation and efficiency. 

Uses a module based approach, allowing for different demo scenes that are essentially separate from one another
, while common elements such as the renderer, textures etc are encapsulated within the rest of the application.

Currently the project contains the following modules:

- Triangle, quad, cube Shapes
- Stanford Dragon model

While a short list, each module supports, through the application:

- Transform modification
- Textured & untextured modes
- Lit & unlit shaders
